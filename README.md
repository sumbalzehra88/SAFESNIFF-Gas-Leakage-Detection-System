# SAFESNIFF-Gas-Leakage-Detection-System
Gas leaks pose a serious threat to public safety, often going undetected until it's too late. Traditional detection methods lack real-time alerts and accessibility. SAFESNIFF is a smart, IoT-based gas leakage alert system designed to detect harmful gas presence and instantly notify users through audio signals and a BLYNK based dashboard.
